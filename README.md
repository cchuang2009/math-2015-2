# R for Bio-statistics

These lectures is written based on the book
```
Principles of Biostatistics (with CD-ROM) 2nd Edition
by Marcello Pagano (Author), Kimberlee Gauvreau 
```
and some basic notes about biostatistics.

The resources include the R-codes for exercises mostly; You can install the 

- [anaconda and R-essentials](https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer/jupyter-and-conda-r);
- [our live Linux system on USB](http://diffusion.cgu.edu.tw/ftp/porteus/64bit) download **Jupyter-4.1-Python35.iso**.

to run the codes.
